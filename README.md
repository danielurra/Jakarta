## Just a few useful notes about Jakarta
As you probably know `Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)`, was recently transferred from **Oracle** to the **Eclipse Software Foundation**<br>
and renamed to `Jakarta` but widely referred to by the previous name (and occasionally by its very old name, “J2EE,” which was retired in 2005).<br>
Java EE provides scalability and support for building well-structured, multitiered distributed applications.<br>
EE provides the servlet framework; a servlet is a strategy object that can be installed into any standard Java EE web server.<br>
EE also provides two web view technologies: 
* The original JSP (JavaServer Pages) and the newer,
* component-based JSF (JavaServer Faces). <br>
Finally, EE provides a number of other network-based services, including EJB3 remote access and Java Messaging Service (JMS).
